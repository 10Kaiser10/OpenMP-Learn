# OpenMP-Learn
 Solutions to Exercises from the OpenMP course by Intel on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLbPZJxtMs4ZHSamRRYCtvowRS0qIwC-I
 
 All code is present in the Exercises directory. Solutions start with a number, for example 021_Pi_Serial.cpp. Files that don't start with a number usually contain wrong code to be corrected as a part of the exercise.
